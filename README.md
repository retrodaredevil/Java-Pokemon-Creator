# Java-Pokemon-Creator
A pokemon creator game that is run on java using the Slick2d api

It was written by retrodaredevil in December 2016. I am proud of it however, it's documentation is horrible and there are probably some bad practices in the code along with alright formatting. The compiled jar is not public so if someone is interested in it, message me.
